John 	- 10/10
Joseph	-  5/10 - it looks like most of what you worked on was level 3. let me know if that's incorrect.
7/10 points for providing a thoughtful reflection in your README file
-not sure who wrote the reflection, so same points for both of you. either way, it could have been more in-depth. what you do have is right on the mark though.
0/5 points for reviewing your collaboratorsâ€™ pull requests (if solo, instead these points will come from your reflection)
